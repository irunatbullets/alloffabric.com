title: Can you add Astromine back?/How come Astromine is gone?
content: "Astromine has been removed because the developers have ceased developing
  the mod. Astromine uses an MIT license, so you are free to fork it. [https://github.com/Mixinors/Astromine](https://github.com/Mixinors/Astromine
  \"https://github.com/Mixinors/Astromine\") \n\nHowever, because it is no longer
  being developed, we have no desire to keep it in the pack when there are existing
  bugs and incomplete feature."
